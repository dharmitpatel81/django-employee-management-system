## Employee Management System Web App

An Employee Management System in Django keeps track of all of the employee’s information and data. I have created employee’s CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations. This is a role-based module in which the admin can perform any operation on the data.

In addition to this, admin can also add testimonials details from Django-admin panel and render it in a template.

This Application was created using Python, Django, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap.
